    <h2>Content Strategy:</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Content Strategy:</strong> Im wanting to keep the goal simple with my site so since it is the basics of buying cards I want to keep the eyes of the viewer locked on the screen so adding gif images next to the simple instructions should suffice. I am only having 4 card games so I will be putting a thumbnail for each. The Contact form is for anyone on the website to email me as well as social media links to reach me for more questions on trading cards. Added a little bio in the contact form section just for familiarity.<br>

    <h2>WireFrame Flow:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First line of text at the top left will be a quote.</li>
        <li>Within the next container the first text box will have me introducing tcg.</li>
        <li>The first image will be a gif of any card game I haven't decided yet all I know is that it will be the same as one of the card games I introduce.</li>
        <li>The second text box Will introduce 2 links to separate card sites tcgplayer.com and troll and toad potentially.</li>
        <li>The next image will be a relatable meme if I can find a good one. If not maybe I can add some stick figures playing cards.</li>
        <li>The next four images will be 4 different tcgs specifically yu-gi-oh, magic, metazoo and Pok√©mon. Potentially will be images of kids drawings of each individual tcg I find online and shrink the image down to its face.</li>
        <li>I have 2 text boxes for this container because i want the 4 boxes to be able to show the information when you hover over the image either to the right or underneath if I choose underneath i can add more stick figures to fill that empty space.</li>
        <li>A big title is my contact form title area , I have the form set up to send me emails, The text to the right details a bit of who I am as a hobbyist.</li>
        <li>the three links at the bottom will be links to my social media.</li>
    </ul>
