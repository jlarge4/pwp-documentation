    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Content Strategy:</strong> Im wanting to keep the goal simple with my site so since it is the basics of buying cards I want to keep the eyes of the viewer locked on the screen so adding gif images next to the simple instructions should suffice. I am only having 4 card games so I will be putting a thumbnail for each. The Contact form is for anyone on the website to email me as well as social media links to reach me for more questions on trading cards. Added a little bio in the contact form section just for familiarity.
